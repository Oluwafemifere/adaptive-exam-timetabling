"""
RoomFitPenaltyConstraint - Soft Constraint for Phase 2

This constraint penalizes assigning an exam to a room that is much larger than necessary.
It encourages the solver to find the "best fit" room for each exam, leading to
more efficient space utilization and preventing all exams from being placed in a single large room.
